## Data Validation

The original <a href="https://github.com/dawsonkate/Data-Validation-Discovery-and-Visualisation/blob/main/claims.csv">data</a> has 98 rows (+1 header) and 8 columns. 

The first thing I did was double check that the claims.csv columns match the dataset description. 
 
 All columns are present. 
- ClaimID, as expected. 98 unique Claim_id, 98 rows.
- Time_to_CLose, outlier found. Values from (DESC) 3591 to -57. This column represents the number of days, so it cannot be negative. Need to validate information relating to the row showing '-57'. The second smallest number is 29.
- Claim_Amount column looks a bit strange. According to the dataset description it should be converted (“R$50,000.00” should be converted into 50000) so this is what I did. Then I CAST to numeric. Now the column matches the description.
- Amount_Paid, FLOAT data type. CAST to numeric.
- Location, as expected. Four possible locations. Data is clean.
- Individuals on Claim, as expected. Range 41 to 0.
- Linked_Cases, as expected. Count: TRUE 9, FALSE 89.
- Cause. Null values present. Replaced empty rows with 'unknown' as per Dataset Description. Now 3 possible categories - 'vegetable', 'meat', 'unknown'.

At the end I double checked if the data type is correct for all of the columns and changed it if it doesn't match the description.
